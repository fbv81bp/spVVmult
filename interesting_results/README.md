Hashing the otherwise anyway random numbers can only balance the hash trie structured unbalanced tree, and seemingly the algorithm finishes in around 75% of the O(N+M) comparisons, theoretically needed in a worst case two pointer solution.

Okay, I haven't tested for any corner cases. True. Any corner cases for hashed random values?
